📌 Crypto Clustering

🚀 Analyzing and clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means and PCA

📂 Project Structure:
	•	Crypto_Clustering.ipynb → Main notebook with data analysis
	•	Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb → Provided starter code
	•	Resources/crypto_market_data.csv → Dataset for analysis

🔍 Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies based on market data.

📊 Key steps include:
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing: Load, clean, and scale the dataset
2️⃣ K-Means Clustering: Find the optimal number of clusters (k)
3️⃣ Dimensionality Reduction: Apply PCA to optimize clustering
4️⃣ Visualization: Generate interactive plots with hvPlot

📂 Installation & Dependencies

✅ Google Colab
✅ Required libraries: pandas, hvplot, sklearn, StandardScaler, KMeans, PCA

📊 Key Insights

🔹 Elbow Method: Optimal k found at 4 clusters
🔹 PCA Optimization: Reduced features from multiple dimensions to 3 principal components
🔹 Cluster Analysis: Compared clusters before & after PCA

📍 Visualized crypto groupings using scatter plots with different markers.

🖥️ Running the Project

1️⃣ Open Crypto_Clustering.ipynb in Google Colab
2️⃣ Run the notebook step by step
3️⃣ Analyze and interpret the K-Means results
4️⃣ Compare performance with and without PCA optimization
